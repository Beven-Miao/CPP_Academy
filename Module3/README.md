#Exercise in chapter 3

1. If a short on a given machine has 16 bits then what is the largest number that can be assigned to a short? To an unsigned short?

2. Write a program to read the standard input a line at a time. Modify your program to read a word at a time.

3. Write a program to read two strings and report whether the strings are equal. If not, report which of the two is the larger. Now, change the program to report whether the strings have the same length and if not report which is longer.

4. Write a program to read strings from the standard input, concatenating what is read into one large string. Print the concatenated string. Next, change the program to separate adjacent input strings by a space.

5. Write a program to strip the punctuation from a string. The input to the program should be a string of characters including punctuation; the output should be a string in which the punctuation is removed.

6. Read a set of integers into a vector. Calculate and print the sum of each pair of adjacent elements in the vector. If there is an odd number, tell the user and print the value of the last element without summing it. Now change your program so that it prints the sum of the first and last elements, followed by the sum of the second and second-to-last and so on.

7. Read some text into a vector, storing each word in the input as an element in the vector. Transform each word into uppercase letters. Print the transformed elements from the vector, printing eight words to a line.

8. Write a program to create a vector with 10 elements. Using an iterator, assign each element a value that is twice its current value. Test your program by printing the vector.
